## Regular Links (Non-Affiliate)

These links should NOT trigger the affiliate disclosure:

- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

## Conclusion

This post demonstrates how our affiliate disclosure system works. The disclosure should appear at the top of this post because we have affiliate links present.

**Expected behavior:**
- Affiliate disclosure should be visible
- Affiliate links should be styled differently (green color, link icon)
- Regular links should remain unchanged
