# Best Tech Products 2025 - Affiliate Test

This post contains affiliate links to demonstrate our affiliate disclosure component. Check out these amazing products!

## Laptop Recommendations

### MacBook Pro M3
The new MacBook Pro M3 is incredibly powerful for developers and creators. 

[Buy MacBook Pro M3 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5JV268) - This is an affiliate link that should trigger our disclosure.

### Dell XPS 13
A great Windows alternative with excellent build quality.

[Check Dell XPS 13 Price](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKDYWK5) - Another affiliate link for testing.

## Accessories

### Wireless Mouse
[Logitech MX Master 3](https://amzn.to/3abc123) - Great for productivity.

### Keyboard
[Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZGDPT4M) - Perfect for coding.

## Regular Links (Non-Affiliate)

These links should NOT trigger the affiliate disclosure:

- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

## Conclusion

This post demonstrates how our affiliate disclosure system works. The disclosure should appear at the top of this post because we have affiliate links present.

**Expected behavior:**
- Affiliate disclosure should be visible
- Affiliate links should be styled differently (green color, link icon)
- Regular links should remain unchanged
